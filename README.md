# Activity-ES2015-Classes
The Iron Yard Week 9.3: Pair Programming Activity: ES2015 Classes 

## Instructions  
In this activity, your task is to complete each unfinished class and subclass. Instructions accompany each function explaining what the function should do and what value it should return. You will implement logic using class, extends, and super.
All of the function tasks can be found in script.js

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
